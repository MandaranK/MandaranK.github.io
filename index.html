            <h3>Hi! I am currently in my first year of the University of Waterloo's Electrical/Computer Engineering Program.</h3>
            <p>I've always had a keen interest in designing and programming both hardware and software systems. I have gained these experiences through my work history, projects, and the courses I've taken.<br><br>
                I have had a lot of experience in the field of hardware like circuit design, working with Microcontrollers, CAD, and more. I also have a lot of experience with programming both back-end and front-end projects over the years.<br><br>
                In this website, you can view my portfolio of hardware and software projects I have done over the past few years.</p>

                    <h4>UV Radiation Detection System</h4>
                    <p> Designed to take solar radiation as a voltage input value through the light sensor.<br>
                        Programmed to convert it into a UV index value, to be displayed and updated on an LCD monitor, in addition to informing the user how much skin protection is needed outside.<br>
                        The STM32 Microcontroller was programmed in C, using the STM32Cube IDE.<br>
                        The outer structure was designed in Autodesk AutoCAD and later 3D printed.

                        The outer structure is 3D printed, with Analog Line Sensors, DC Motors, and Arduino.<br>
                        Line sensors and motors on the wheels are programmed for automation through the Arduino, in C using the Arduino IDE.

                <p>This app displays the current weather, hourly temperatures, and windspeed of any city across the world with the use of global Weather API. 
                    JSON Object Request from the Volley library was used in Android Studio to retrieve the API data. 
                    The User Interface was designed to be aesthetic and simple to navigate.</p>
